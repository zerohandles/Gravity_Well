Easy as she goes there Kelly.  I know we are all looking forward to some time off, but I  want a safe flight home.  #speaker:Cpt. Morris 
Yes Captain. #speaker: Sgt. Kelly
Captain, these mining jobs are just the worst.  Long hours, out in the middle of no where and worst of all is the bordem.  Nothing to look at but cold grey rocks all day. #speaker:Pvt. Toms
Stow it private.  We take the work that is required of us. #speaker:Cpt. Morris
Yes sir...I just wish there was something more exciting we could be doing...sir. #speaker:Pvt. Toms
Captain! We've just flown into a massive gravitational field!  I'm giving it all we've got, but we can't get free. #speaker:Sgt. Kellys #event:Rumble Event
Divert all power from weapons and shields to the engines. #speaker:Cpt. Morris
But Captain, if anything else gets pulled in towards us we'll have to power down the engines to blast it out of our way. #speaker:Sgt. Kelly
Just do it Sergeant!  #speaker:Cpt. Morris
